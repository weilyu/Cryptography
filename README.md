# Brief Introduction of This Repo
I'm recently taking Java Programming courses on Coursera.com. And this repo contains all codes I write while taking these courses.

Notice: edu.duke and org.apache.commons.csv packages are provided by Duke University. And other Java codes are 100% written by myself.

I'm now taking these courses:
- Java Programming: An Introduction to Software Specialization
  - Programming and the Web for Beginners (completed and certificated)
  - Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software (completed and certificated)
  - Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data (working on it!~)
